# 2019-Robot-Code
The 2019 Season Robot Code

In order to push to the master branch, you must be approved by Brenden @bwest328 and or Jacob @Lainkai. This is to maintain quality of the code. They will assign you to a team, and they will try to make sure you understand what you are doing.

If you are having issue pushing, make sure you have switched to the appropriate branch. If you don't know how to switch branches, please see [here](https://github.com/Team3487-RedPrideRobotics/3487robotCode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Please try to stay contained in your work. Because we have a large controls team this year, we need to ration our work as evenly as possible.
