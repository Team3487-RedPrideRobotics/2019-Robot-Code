The 2019 Season Robot Code


EVERYONE must ask me BEFORE pushing ANYTHING to the robot code.  That includes you too, Jake.
You're all doing good work but some of you are going a bit overboard and changing everything without anyone knowing.
We all need to know what's going on here.
Yes we need to work as a team but in the grand scheme of things, Brenden is the captain, so listen to him.
If there are any questions as to what you're allowed to do, email me at my personal (bwest328@gmail.com), school (bwest7410@redpride.net), use the [Discord](https://discord.gg/q6gphDh)
